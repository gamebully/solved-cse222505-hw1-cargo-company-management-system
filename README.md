As the second part of the first homework, the scenario given in the first part will be designed by using ArrayList instead of Array. For reminder purposes, it is reshared below. Also, unlike the first part, you are expected to make an <strong>object oriented design</strong> in this part. It is important!

<strong>SCENARIO:</strong>

The automation system for a cargo company has users such as administrators, branch employees, transportation personnel and customers. Administrators manage the system by adding and removing branches, branch employees and transportation personnel. Branch employees can enter and remove information about the shipments sent from that branch, add and remove users (customers) to the system. The information of the sender and receiver are recorded for each shipment. When the package arrives at a branch or leaves the branch, its current status is entered into the system by the branch employee. When it is delivered, the transportation personnel makes the update. The customer entering the system with the tracking number is only authorized to see the name and surname information of the sender and receiver and the current status of the cargo.

Design and implement the automation system for a cargo company. You can define additional requirements as necessary.
